# Question Answerer
## What is this?
The server allows you to define 4 answer questions and in the macOS app you can fetch those questions, answer them and see how many of them you've answered correctly.

## What's the point of this? 
It's just a sample educational (mostly) project for getting more familiar with macOS development, also it may be a good starting point to write a quiz app.

## Why two macOS version?
They behave mostly the same. I just wanted to see how much harder and time consuming is to write it with AppKit rather than SwiftUI. (and boy it's so much!)
